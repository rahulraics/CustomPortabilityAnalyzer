# .NET Portability Analyzer (Visual Studio Extension)

The .NET Portability Analyzer helps you determine how flexible your application
is across .NET Platforms. For more information about platform portability
analysis, read ["Platform Portability"][PlatformPortability].

__Features__

* Analysis of a single project, solution, or binaries
* Analysis against multiple .NET platforms simultaneously
* Generation of multiple analysis reports in different formats. Supported
formats are:
    * JSON
    * HTML
    * Excel
* Configurable report options in the Options pane
* View and save generated reports in a tool window
* Up-to-date server-side analysis
    * __NOTE__ .NET platform targets and report formats are constantly fetched
    from an Azure cloud service that is updated constantly. In addition, the
    analysis is performed remotely so the information is always the latest.
    * We only send .NET APIs to the service to analyze for portability. For more
    information, our privacy policy is [here][PrivacyPolicy].

## Usage

### Analyze a Visual Studio solution or project

You can run the Portability Analyzer over a Visual Studio solution or project by
performing the following:

1. Open a project or solution in Visual Studio
2. Open Solution Explorer
3. Right-click on the project or solution you want to analyze
4. Select "Analyze Assembly Portability"

![Context menu in Solution Explorer][SolutionExplorer-ContextMenu]

After the analysis is complete, if there are any APIs that are not supported on
the selected platforms, check the "Output" window.  There should be some
informational messages containing the API that is not supported and the line
mapping in source code.  If you double-click on that message, it will take you
to that location in source.
