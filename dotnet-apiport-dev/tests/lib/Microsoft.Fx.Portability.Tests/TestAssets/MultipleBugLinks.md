## 5: List<T>.ForEach

### Scope
Minor

### Version Introduced
4.5
    
### Source Analyzer Status
Available

### Change Description
Beginning in .NET 4.5, a List&lt;T&gt;.ForEach enumerator will throw an InvalidOperationException exception if an element in the calling collection is modified. Previously, this would not throw an exception but could lead to race conditions.

- [x] Quirked
- [ ] Build-time break

### Recommended Action
Ideally, code should be fixed such that Lists are not modifed while enumerating their elements, as that is never a safe operation. To revert to the previous behavior, though, an app may target .NET 4.0.

### Affected APIs
* M:System.Collections.Generic.List`1.ForEach(System.Action{`0})
